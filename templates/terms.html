               It is free to create letworkbedones. A new Seller may create up to ten letworkbedones. After successfully completing one order, a Seller may create an unlimited number of letworkbedones.
            </li>
            <li>
               Each letworkbedone is manually approved by a Support Specialist before being posted in the Marketplace. letworkbedone reserves the right to modify or delete letworkbedones that violate these Terms of Service and/or the Related documents. Users can learn more about the approval process for letworkbedones <a href="{% url 'approval_process' %}">here</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
               By selling a letworkbedone, Sellers agree to render all included services for all orders of the letworkbedone. Sellers do not have the right to refuse to sell an active letworkbedone to a Buyer who pays for the order and provides all necessary information to complete it. Sellers provide their services to Buyers independently and bear full responsibility for the completion or non-completion of all orders. It is prohibited to divide a single order of the same service into several smaller orders (i.e. creating duplicate orders) to artificially increase a Seller’s total number of orders. In such cases, letworkbedone reserves the right to penalize letworkbedones and/or the User.
            </li>
            <li>
               Sellers are prohibited from misleading Buyers regarding the service(s) they provide. Violations will result in sanctions and/or the permanent suspension of the offending letworkbedone and/or the Seller’s account.
            </li>
            <li>
               If a violation is reported, letworkbedone has the right to remove such content.
            </li>
            <li>
               Should it be deemed fit, letworkbedone reserves the right to unilaterally hide work from a User's portfolio.
            </li>
            <li>
               Sellers must remove any and all mistakes, errors, or inconsistencies on a letworkbedone page as soon as they are discovered. A common error is a discrepancy between the scope, delivery, price, and other fields of a letworkbedone. For instance, suppose a Seller writes in their letworkbedone’s description that the scope of their letworkbedone is 1,000 words, but enters 2,000 words in the "Scope of this letworkbedone '' field. In that case, the true volume will be considered 2,000 words. The information indicated in the dedicated field shall prevail and take precedence over all else. All disputes arising from such discrepancies shall be resolved in favor of the Buyer.

               Before starting an order, the User (Seller) must make sure that it complies with letworkbedone's list of <a href="{% url 'prohibited_service' %}">Prohibited Services</a>.

               If a Buyer's assignment differs in description and scope from the service described by the Seller and the Seller accepted the order, priority is given to the Buyer's assignment.

               An order is marked as Complete after it is approved by the Buyer or after arbitration is completed.&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
               After a letworkbedone is delivered, the Buyer has three business days (or four days if more than one day falls on a weekend) to approve the delivery. If during this period the Buyer neither approves or requests revisions, the order will be automatically approved and considered completed. If the order’s price is more than $150, the approval period is five business days (or six if more than one day falls on a weekend).
            </li>
            <li>
               A task-based order is marked as complete when the final task is delivered and approved by the Buyer. If a task is not approved or no revisions are requested, the task will be automatically approved and marked as completed after three business days (or four days if more than a day falls on a weekend). If the task’s price is more than $150, the approval period is five business days (or six if more than one day falls on a weekend).
            </li>
            <li>
               In this case, the entire order will be suspended and will only resume once the next task is paid for. If the Buyer does not pay for the next task within five days, the Seller will not be able to start working on it. At the same time, completed tasks cannot be canceled.
            </li>
            <li>
               &nbsp;As per letworkbedone rules, the seller’s delivery must be of high quality. When a delivery contains an excessive amount of objectively verifiable mistakes, the order is considered incomplete.
            </li>
            <li>
               As per letworkbedone rules, if a buyer cannot review a seller’s delivery (for example, if the seller fails to provide proof of work or a final product), the order is considered incomplete.

If an order is not fulfilled, clearly does not meet the standards explicitly set on the letworkbedone page, or does not meet the Buyer’s order requirements, the Buyer may return the delivered work to the Seller for revision.&nbsp; In this case Sellers must provide as many revisions until the delivery meets the standards agreed upon without asking for additional payment.&nbsp;

            <li>
               Both Sellers and Buyers have the right to cancel any order by providing a valid cancelation reason. Once a cancelation is confirmed by the other party, payment is refunded to the Buyer. If a Buyer chooses to cancel an order because a Seller misses a deadline, the funds will be returned to the Buyer immediately without the need for confirmation from the Seller.
            </li>
            <li>
               Orders cannot be canceled on the basis of a Buyer’s subjective evaluation of a Seller’s delivery as long as the service was provided in accordance with the information provided on the letworkbedone page.
            </li>
            <li>
               letworkbedone reserves the right to cancel any order that violates these Terms of Service at any time.
            </li>
            <li>
               letworkbedone reserves the right to cancel orders for any reason. Common cancelation reasons are:
               <ul style="margin-left:40px;">
                  <li>
                     The Seller does not accept the order within 24 hours or misses the deadline and is unresponsive for more than two weeks.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Users display aggressive behavior, use order materials (such as personal information) against each other, or Buyers threaten Sellers with a bad review
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Users have provided or included materials that violate a third party’s intellectual property rights
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Users withhold the delivery of services, files, or information required to complete a letworkbedone with the intent to gain favorable reviews, additional services, or extra payment
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     The Seller submits an order for approval without a complete result in order to extend the order deadline
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               Sellers must deliver a product that reflects the description of their letworkbedone and meets all Buyer requirements. Failure to comply with this requirement will allow the Buyer to cancel the order, and may damage the Seller's status. When the deadline has passed the order is marked as Overdue.
            </li>
            <li>
               letworkbedone reserves the right to cancel any completed orders or tasks in task-based orders, if they are in severe violation of letworkbedone’s Terms of Service (e.g. the type of service is prohibited on letworkbedone, or the order may be fraudulent, etc.). In such cases, the sum paid for the canceled order or task will be refunded to the Buyer's balance and will be deducted from the Seller's balance or, if there are insufficient funds on the Seller's balance, from the future Earnings of the Seller. Funds for such an order will be removed from the Seller's balance regardless of when the order was completed.
            </li>
            <li>
               Partial cancelation of an order is not possible. An order may only be canceled completely and with a valid cancelation reason. Reasons for canceling include but are not limited to:

         <ul style="margin-left:40px;">
            <li>
               All intellectual property rights associated with the delivery of an order are transferred to the Buyer after the successful completion and payment of the order, unless an alternate agreement is reached between the Buyer and the Seller. If intellectual property involves elements subject to licensing, the Seller is obliged to transfer the license or, if applicable, provide the Buyer with a reasonable warning regarding the need for the additional acquisition of a relevant license.
            </li>
            <li>
               All transfer and assignment of intellectual property to the Buyer shall be subject to full payment for the letworkbedone, and the delivery may not be used if payment is canceled for any reason. Violation of this rule may result in the suspension of a Buyer’s account.
            </li>
            <li>
               Unless otherwise specified, Sellers are not entitled to receive and may not solicit from the Buyer any and all royalties earned from the sale of their work.
            </li>
            <li>
               Some letworkbedones require the purchase of a license for commercial use. In such cases, if a User (Buyer) purchases a letworkbedone for personal use, the Buyer will own all the rights necessary for such use, and will not need a license for commercial use. But if the Buyer intends to use it for any purposes that are directly or indirectly related to any business or in any other way intended for profit, the Buyer will need to purchase a license for commercial use in the manner provided for by the relevant letworkbedone.

                              Sellers represent and warrant that they comply at all times with their obligations under income tax provisions in their jurisdiction. Prices shown on letworkbedone include all taxes and charges that may apply to Sellers.

                              The current legislation may require letworkbedone or the Partners to charge Users with indirect taxes (such as Sales Tax, VAT or GST) or to withhold taxes.&nbsp;

                                 Any disputes and disagreements between a Seller and a Buyer are resolved through one-on-one negotiations or with the assistance of a Support Team Specialist. If negotiations are unsuccessful, the Buyer or the Seller has the right to apply for arbitration.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                 To apply for arbitration, a User should click the arbitration link under Help located on the Order Page, indicate the relevant category, and fill out the arbitration form. The arbitration link appears once the order is submitted for approval. The application should contain the applicant's username, the username of the other party in the dispute, the number and identification of the order under dispute, and evidence supporting your position in the dispute.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                 The application will be forwarded to a competent letworkbedone’s Support Team Specialist (the arbiter) to evaluate and resolve the dispute. A decision will be reached within 3 business days; however, this time period may be extended in exceptionally challenging circumstances.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                 Arbiters do not evaluate orders’ creative components, including but not limited to colors, fonts, and writing style (with the exception of deliveries that clearly do not correspond to the standards displayed in the Seller’s portfolio).
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                 When working on an order, Sellers should never take action that could harm Buyers. For example, Sellers should not make edits or upload files that would harm the site or the site’s users while working with site accesses. If a Buyer is found to have been hurt by a Seller, the arbiter will cancel the order, and the Seller's account will be penalized and/or suspended.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                 Should an arbiter discover that an order is in severe violation of letworkbedone’s Terms of Service (e.g. the type of service is prohibited on letworkbedone, or the order may be fraudulent, etc.), the arbiter has the right to cancel the order and apply sanctions to both parties. If&nbsp;the order is&nbsp;fraudulent or&nbsp;in&nbsp;clear violation of&nbsp;the law, the Buyer’s payment shall be&nbsp;returned to&nbsp;their credit/debit card, WebMoney wallet, or&nbsp;Payoneer account. In&nbsp;other cases, the funds shall be&nbsp;returned to&nbsp;the Buyer’s Balance.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                 If Seller and Buyer have come to a mutual agreement regarding partial payment for the order, letworkbedone's arbiter will decide based on the wishes of both parties and the Terms of Service.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                 A Buyer maintains the right to leave a review for an order that ends in arbitration, even if the arbiter rules in favor of the Seller. A Buyer may not leave a review when they request additional services that exceed the original scope of the order from the Seller.
